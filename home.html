          <h2>Breaking News: World War III Averted by Coin Toss</h2>

          <p>
            In a surprising turn of events, the leaders of the United States,
            Russia, China, and North Korea have agreed to settle their
            differences by a simple coin toss, instead of launching nuclear
            missiles at each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            The historic decision was made after hours of tense negotiations at
            the United Nations headquarters in New York, where the four leaders
            realized that they had no other option but to resort to a game of
            chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We were running out of time and patience," said US President Joe
            Biden. "We had to find a way to end this madness before it was too
            late."
          </p>
          <p>
            "It was either heads or tails, or fire and fury," said Russian
            President Vladimir Putin. "We chose the former."
          </p>
          <p>
            "We respect the outcome of the coin toss," said Chinese President Xi
            Jinping. "We hope that this will lead to a more peaceful and stable
            world."
          </p>
          <p>
            "We are not happy with the result, but we accept it," said North
            Korean leader Kim Jong-un. "We will not launch any more rockets or
            missiles."
          </p>
          <p>
            The coin toss was conducted by UN Secretary-General Antonio
            Guterres, who used a special commemorative coin with the UN logo on
            one side and a peace symbol on the other. The coin landed on the
            peace symbol, which meant that the four leaders had to shake hands
            and call off their war plans.
